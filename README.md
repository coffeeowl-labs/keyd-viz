The visual face of [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd): a native Linux GUI that draws your
keyboard from your keyd config and lights it up **live** — layer switches and keypresses as they
happen.

keyd is a brilliant config-file keyboard remapper, but unlike QMK/VIA there's no GUI to *see* your
layout. Once you have a few tap/hold layers going, it's easy to forget what `hold space` or
`hold f` actually does. keyd-viz parses your `.conf` files, draws them, and then shows the live
state as you type.

## What it does

- **Draws your real layout** from `/etc/keyd/*.conf` — a base board plus one board per layer, with
  keyd's tap/hold model rendered distinctly (tap legend on the key, hold action as a badge).
- **Live layer view** — the board follows keyd, switching to the active layer as you hold
  `nav`/`sym`/etc.
- **Live keypress glow** — caps light up as you press them, using keyd's *post-remap* output, so
  layer outputs and chords glow the right keys (nav `n` = `C-left` lights `n`, not the arrow).
- **Live config reload** — edit a `.conf` and the board redraws within ~1s, no restart.
- **Follows your keyboards** — detects connected devices and shows the matching config.

## Architecture

A Rust workspace plus a small system service:

- **`crates/core`** (`keydviz-core`) — pure keyd logic: the `.conf` parser, the board model, key
  naming. No I/O; fully unit-tested.
- **`crates/app`** (`keydviz`) — the [Slint](https://slint.dev) GUI.
- **`crates/helper`** (`keydviz-helperd`) — a tiny, hardened broker daemon that reads keyd's live
  state and streams it to the GUI, so you need **no special permissions** to see live layers and
  keypresses. See [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md) for its security model (non-root,
  sandboxed, network-isolated, keypresses opt-in).

## Install

### AppImage — any distro (GUI only)

Download `keyd-viz-*-x86_64.AppImage` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/coffeeowl-labs/keyd-viz/releases), make it executable, and
run it. Without the broker (below) the GUI reads keyd directly, which needs membership in the
`keyd`/`input` groups.

### AUR (Arch) — full experience

Available on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/keyd-viz) — the
[`PKGBUILD`](packaging/aur/) installs the GUI, the broker service, a desktop entry, and the icon:

```sh
paru -S keyd-viz
sudo systemctl enable --now keydviz-helperd   # broker: live layers, zero per-user setup
keydviz
```

Keypress glow is opt-in (it reads `/dev/input`) — the package prints how to enable it.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/coffeeowl-labs/keyd-viz
cd keyd-viz
cargo build --release -p keydviz        # -> target/release/keydviz

./packaging/install.sh                  # broker service, layers only (safe default)
./packaging/install.sh --keys           # also enable keypress glow (reads /dev/input)
```

The GUI auto-discovers the broker socket — no groups to join, no logout. Without the helper it
falls back to reading keyd directly (needs the `keyd`/`input` groups); the helper is the
recommended zero-permission path. See [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md) for the
security model.

## Usage

These assume `keydviz` is on your `PATH` (`cargo install --path crates/app` drops it in
`~/.cargo/bin`); otherwise run `./target/release/keydviz`.

```sh
keydviz                          # detect connected keyboards, show their /etc/keyd configs
keydviz examples/hhkb.conf       # render specific config(s)
keydviz --list                   # print the detection result and exit (no GUI)
keydviz --demo                   # cycle layers/keys with synthetic data (no keyd needed)
```

### Zoom, compact mode & pinning

Scroll over the board (or use the `−`/`+` controls) to resize it; the window auto-fits.
**Compact** hides all chrome for a minimal, pinnable keyboard-only window — a corner
reminder of the active layer.

The **pin** button keeps the window above other windows (compact mode also pins
automatically). This is honored on **X11/XWayland**. On **native Wayland** there is no way
for an app to keep *itself* on top — that's the compositor's job — so the in-app pin is a
no-op there; use your compositor's keep-above instead (KDE: right-click the titlebar →
*More Actions → Keep Above Window*, or a KWin window rule for window class `keydviz`).

## How keyd bindings render

For each config it draws a **base board** plus **one board per layer**:

| keyd binding                          | shown as |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `f = lettermod(nav, f, ...)`          | key `F` with a `↓nav` badge; a `NAV` board where the held key is outlined `HOLD` |
| `k = lettermod(control, k, ...)`      | key `K` with a `↓Ctrl` badge |
| `capslock = overload(control, esc)`   | tap legend `Esc` + a `↓Ctrl` badge |
| `capslock = layer(control)`           | `Ctrl` (pure modifier), original legend ghosted |
| `leftcontrol = capslock`              | `Caps` (plain remap), original legend ghosted |
| `leftshift+rightshift = toggle(game)` | `⇧⇧` chord badge; a `GAME` board |
| `[nav] h = left`                      | `←` on the NAV board, the key's normal legend ghosted in the corner |

Physical layouts come from a curated catalog (pick one in-app), or import a board from QMK with
`--qmk-info <info.json>`.

## Edit mode

The **edit** toggle turns the viewer into a visual config editor: click a key on the board,
set its binding, watch the board re-render, then persist. Files the editor can't reproduce
byte-for-byte stay view-only — it never risks clobbering what it doesn't fully understand.

Set a key's binding by typing it, pressing the key you want (**capture**), or searching
keyd's full key list (**pick…**). You can also:

- make a key **dual-function** (tap/hold) — pick a hold layer or modifier and a tap key,
  with an outcome-labelled "feel" instead of raw timeout knobs (an existing key's timings
  are preserved as-is).
- **unbind** a key so keyd stops remapping it — on a sub-layer it inherits the base layer;
  on the base layer keyd just forwards the key's real code (it ceases to intercept — keyd
  sits above the firmware, so this isn't a QMK-style transparent fall-through).
- see an inline warning when a binding activates a **layer that doesn't exist**
  (`layer(symbols)` with no `[symbols]` section) — keyd would reject the file, caught here
  before you apply.

Two ways to persist:

- **Save draft** (works everywhere): writes the edited config to
  `~/.config/keyd-viz/drafts/` and shows copy-paste install steps (`sudo cp …` +
  `sudo keyd reload`), with the diff and a `keyd check` verdict.
- **One-click apply** (AUR/source installs): the **apply to /etc/keyd…** button hands the
  config to `keydviz-apply`, a one-shot privileged tool, via polkit (`pkexec` — expect a
  password prompt each time, by design). The tool validates with `keyd check`, writes
  atomically with a timestamped backup, reloads keyd, and then **counts down**:

  > **Only clicking KEEP makes the change permanent.** Timeout, closing the app, hiding
  > the window, a crash — anything but KEEP — automatically restores the previous config
  > and reloads. The KEEP button is mouse-driven on purpose: confirming must not require
  > the keyboard you just rebound.

  Configs containing `command()` (runs as root on a keypress) or `macro()` need an extra
  explicit confirmation before the password prompt.

  If a keyboard ever ends up unusable anyway, keyd's panic sequence —
  **Backspace+Escape+Enter** — terminates keyd and restores the raw keyboard.

The AppImage can't ship a safe `pkexec` tool (it can't place a root-owned binary), so it
uses draft-then-install permanently — a packaging trade-off, not a missing feature.

## Development

```sh
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
```

The broker crate links `libsystemd` (logind active-session check), so building it needs the
systemd dev headers (`libsystemd-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu; present by default on systemd distros).

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for the design and what's next.
